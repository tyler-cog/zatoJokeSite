            The sun was in my eyes, my dog 
            was barking, my cat was meowing,
            I didn’t get 8 hours of sleep, I 
            didn’t get my afternoon nap,
            my evening nap, my morning nap,
            my buttons were mapped wrong,
            I was hungry, I was thirsty,
            my glasses were dirty, my contacts 
            fell out, I didn’t have my socks on,
            my controller died, my snackbox
            got eaten, my hands were cold, 
            my monitor was off, I had to do my laundry,
            and I got a cramp. 
            <br> <br>
            But I would probably win the run back if all that didn’t happen.
